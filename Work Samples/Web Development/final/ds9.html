          <h3>Captain Sisko</h3>
          <p>Starting the series at the rank of Commander, he is later promoted. His wife 
          was killed in a battle with the Borg, and he initially blames Captain Picard. 
          Now he raises his son, Jake, by himself on Deep Space Nine.</p>
          <h3>Major Kira</h3>
          <p>A member of the Bajoran militia, she was a freedom-fighter during the 
          dark and violent Cardassian occupation.  Now she is the liason officer to 
          Starfleet, and also serves as Sisko's first officer.</p>
          <h3>Chief O'Brien</h3>
          <p>Formerly the transporter chief on the Enterprise, he transfers to DS9 to 
          become the chief engineer. He has a wife Keiko and daugher Molly aboard the 
          station. O'Brien has sour memories of the Cardassians from a previous war.</p>
          <h3>Doctor Bashir</h3>
          <p>Initially he is comically eager and annoying, but he settles down to become 
          an excellent officer. Bashir becomes best friends with Chief O'Brien.  Later 
          in the series it is revealed that Bashir is genetically engineered, which he 
          and his family have kept secret because it is illegal in the Federation.</p>
          <h3>Jadzia Dax</h3>
          <p>Dax is the Science Officer on DS9.  She is a Trill, which is a "joined species" 
          which consists of a humanoid host body and a worm-like symbiant living inside the 
          host.  The worm-like creature possesses hundreds of years worth of memories and 
          intelligence as it is placed in a new host at the end of the old one's life.</p>
          <h3>Odo</h3>
          <p>Odo is a shapeshifter, and he serves as security chief.  Unlike on the Enterprise, 
          this position does no include tactical or bridge duties, but is a law enforcement post. 
          He also had this job under Cardassian rule, and is considered very objective by all. He 
          is looking for other members of his species, but they will turn out to be the 
          villainous Founders of the Dominion.</p>
          <h3>Quark</h3>
          <p>Quark is a Ferengi bartender, gambler, and criminal who runs a bar and casino 
          on the station.  He is constantly being pursued by Odo, but the two have a 
          grudging friendship.</p>
          <h3>Jake Sisko</h3>
          <p>The son of Captain Sisko, Jake learns early he doesn't want to follow in his 
          father's footsteps and join Starfleet.  Instead, he aspires to become a writer.</p>
