        <h3>Character Notes</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Captain Picard</h4>
          <p>Picard is a philosophical and deeply moralistic Frenchman who is just as likely
          to solve a problem with diplomacy or a well-timed speech as with action.</p>
          <h4>Commander Riker</h4>
          <p>The first officer is called "Number One" by Picard. Riker is more given to action, and 
          is portrayed as a ladies man.</p>
          <h4>Data</h4>
          <p>The 2nd officer and operations officer, Data is an android.  While he often reminds 
          everyone that he has no feelings, his actions often seem driven by instict and imagination.  
          Data is a tremendous intellectual and a ridiculously valuable officer.</p>
          <h4>Worf</h4>
          <p>Worf is the Klingon chief of security.  In the beggining of the series, Worf is mainly 
          known for offering up extremely rash advice and having it completely rejected by Picard.  
          As the series continues, he becomes much more effective.</p>
          <h4>Geordi La Forge</h4>
          <p>Geordi is the chief engineer of the Enterprise.  He is blind, and during the tv series he 
          wears a visor device so that he can "see".  In the movies, this is replaced by artificial eyes. 
          Geordi is a technical genius who often works closely with his friend, Data.</p>
          <h4>Counselor Troi</h4>
          <p>Troi is half-human, half-Betazoid, which makes her "empathic" (she senses others emotions). 
          She has the dual job of advising Picard on the bridge and also serving as the ship's psychologist.</p>
          <h4>Doctor Crusher</h4>
          <p>Long-time friend of Picard's, her husband had died while serving with Picard.  She has one son, 
          Wesley, who serves on the ship for a good deal of the series.</p>
