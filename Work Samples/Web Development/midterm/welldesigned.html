      <h2>Qualities of a Well-Designed Website</h2>
      <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
      <p>People expect websites to work the same way, not to confuse and surprise them.  So you need to follow current conventions 
      for websites.  The header should look and work as expected, the navigation bar should provide access to the rest of the site, 
      and the search box should have plenty of room to type.  In addition, images next to phrases and as well as text that is 
      underlined should be clickable links.  A cart symbol should link to the shopping cart.  The logo takes you home.</p>

      <h3>Web Design That Works on Any Screen</h3>
      <p>It is becoming more and more important to think about mobile phones and tablets when designing a website.  So you need 
      to think ahead when designing.  You can either provide a different website for phones, or you can build the site first 
      with phones in mind, and then enlarge it for desktop computers.  You want important components to be visible on any screen, 
      without side-scrolling, overlapping, or loss of content.</p>

      <h3>A Good Home Page</h3>
      <p>You need to distinguish your site from the competition.  Also, the most important actions a user can take need to be 
      obvious.  Don't waste time with a welcome message.  Good use of grouping and obvious icons are important.  The home page 
      shouldn't link to itself.  Again, we want to see a shopping cart on the home page if we can buy things.</p>

      <h3>Users Don't Want to Get Lost</h3>
      <p>You have to let users understand their location in your site.  You should make clear which link they've just clicked 
      on.  The page heading and link to the page should be identical.  Finally, we need those familiar breadcrumbs showing 
      us the whole path of how we got here, so we can backtrack to any extent we may wish.</p>
