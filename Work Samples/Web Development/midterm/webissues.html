      <h2>Ease of use</h2>
      <p>Web users are very impatient and need to find information immediately.  If they can't find what
        they want, they usually give up and never return to the web page.  Key information should be visible--
        without scrolling--from the start.  A small number of groups of related items should be used on a page.
        A header should be included with a logo, tagline, and navigation bar.  The user should have no trouble
        figuring out what they can click and where it will take them.</p>
      <h2>The web page works with all browsers</h2>
      <p>Ideally, your web page should work with the 5 major web browsers: Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla 
        Firefox, Apple Safari, and Internet Explorer.  Internet Explorer can be the most difficult to work
        with.  It is now possible to use an emulator to test old versions of Internet Explorer.  The other 
        browsers are usally up-to-date.  For our purposes, testing in Chrome and Firefox will be good enough.</p>
      <h2>Consider disabled users</h2>
      <p>We need to make sure everyone can use our website, and this means taking care that it is usable
        by disabled users.  Those who have trouble seeing will need different ways of accessing the text.  We 
        need keyboard shortcuts for anybody who can't use a mouse.</p>
      <h3>Important Accessibility Laws</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</li>
        <li>Sections 504 and 508 of the federal Rehabilitation Act.</li>
        <li>Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Getting your website found</h2>
      <p>You need your website to be high on the list of returned sites from common search engines including 
        Google, Bing, and Yahoo.  You definitely need a good title for your page.  Further, HTML5 is designed 
        to assist in getting your website found by search engines, so it is best to follow the advice of the 
        textbook.  This is a very complicated topic and it is necessary to read more to fully understand it.</p>
      <h2>The website looks good on all screen sizes</h2>
      <p>Whereas people used to use primarily desktop computers to browse the web, mobile phones are now getting 
        more and more popular.  If you design your website to be flexible, it won't get truncated and look bad on 
        a smaller screen.  This can avoid the need for making a completely different site for mobile users.  Phone 
        screen sizes are getting bigger, and many people will be shopping from their phone.  The issue of adapting 
        your site to all screen sizes is very important.</p>
